HTML- HyperText Markup Language 
- HTML tagnames are written between '<' and '>' 
- Most tagnames have an opening and a closing: 
  - "<openingtagname> content </closingtagname>" 
  - As seen above, affected text is contained between the two tags 

- Elements: Identify and structure sections of the page 
- Attributes: Contain information about the data (These can signify color, style, etc.) 
- Values: These work with Attributes (These can be numbers, percentages, words, etc.)
